An Image Processing API that resize and saves the images to local file system of the server.

## What I learned:

* ExpressJS
* TypeScript
* Working with NPM
* Jasmine and Supertest for unit testing and endpoint testing respectively
* Maintaining the project structure by using routes and middlewares

## Usage:
